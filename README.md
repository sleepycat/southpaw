# Southpaw

This is a micro-framework I'm building for my own educational purposes
and to explore some ideas I am interested in from the world of security
and application architechture.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'southpaw', github: 'sleepycat/southpaw'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

This framework should not really be used by anyone. As noted above, its
an experiment to teach myself a few things and kick around some ideas
that interest me.

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/sleepycat/southpaw/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
